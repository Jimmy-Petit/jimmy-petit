    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout my research experiences, from my PhD to my postdoctoral work, I have focused on developing methods to personalise brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to improve their usability and acceptability. In my current postdoctoral position at CNRS, I develop intelligent tutoring systems designed to adapt BCI learning based on users’ brain activity and behaviour. During my postdoctoral research at Harvard Medical School, I evaluated individualised neurofeedback protocols in a clinical setting. During my PhD at the University of Lille, I worked on reactive BCIs, developing personalised methods for adapting stimulation parameters and covering the full interaction loop, from EEG signal processing to system usability assessment.
